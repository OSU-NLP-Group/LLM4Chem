### Molecule Description

**Molecule Captioning**
```
Query: Describe this molecule: <SMILES> CCOC(=O)C1=CN=CN1[C@H](C)C1=CC=CC=C1 </SMILES>

Response: The molecule is an imidazole derivative with short-acting sedative, hypnotic, and general anesthetic properties. Etomidate appears to have gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) like effects, mediated through GABA-A receptor. The action enhances the inhibitory effect of GABA on the central nervous system by causing chloride channel opening events which leads to membrane hyperpolarization.
```

**Molecule Generation**

It is not required to use tags to wrap up the input description.

```
Query: Give me a molecule that satisfies the conditions outlined in the description: The molecule is a member of the class of tripyrroles that is a red-coloured pigment with antibiotic properties produced by Serratia marcescens. It has a role as an antimicrobial agent, a biological pigment, a bacterial metabolite, an apoptosis inducer and an antineoplastic agent. It is a tripyrrole, an aromatic ether and a ring assembly.

Response: Here is a potential molecule: <SMILES> CCCCCC1=C(C)NC(/C=C2\N=C(C3=CC=CN3)C=C2OC)=C1 </SMILES>
```

### Chemical Reaction

**Forward Synthesis**
```
Query: <SMILES> NC1=CC=C2OCOC2=C1.O=CO </SMILES> Based on the reactants and reagents given above, suggest a possible product.

Response: A possible product can be <SMILES> O=CNC1=CC=C2OCOC2=C1 </SMILES> .
```

**Retrosynthesis**
```
Query: Identify possible reactants that could have been used to create the specified product. <SMILES> CC1=CC=C(N)N=C1N </SMILES>

Response: <SMILES> CC(C#N)CCC#N.N </SMILES>
```

## Training

If you need to fine-tune a base model on SMolInstruct, please first clone this repo to your machine, and `cd` to the folder, then use the following command.

```bash
MODELNAME=LlaSMol-Mistral-7B && CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 accelerate launch finetune.py --data_path osunlp/SMolInstruct --base_model mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 --wandb_project LlaSMol --wandb_run_name $MODELNAME --wandb_log_model true --output_dir checkpoint/$MODELNAME
```

The above is an example command for fine-tuning Mistral with LoRA, using 4 GPUs. If with other base models, the lora settings (e.g., `lora_target_modules`) might need to be modified accordingly.



## Usage

Clone this repo to your machine, and `cd` to the folder.

### Generation

You could use the following code to query the models with your questions.

```python
from generation import LlaSMolGeneration

generator = LlaSMolGeneration('osunlp/LlaSMol-Mistral-7B')
generator.generate('Can you tell me the IUPAC name of <SMILES> C1CCOC1 </SMILES> ?')
```

**Note**: 
1. In the input query, please use corresponding tags to wrap up specific content. 
    - SMILES representation: `<SMILES> ... </SMILES>`
    - IUPAC name: `<IUPAC> ... </IUPAC>`
    
    Other tags may appear in models' responses:
    - Molecular formula: `<MOLFORMULA> ... </MOLFORMULA>`
    - Number: `<NUMBER> ... </NUMBER>`
    - Boolean: `<BOOLEAN> ... </BOOLEAN>`

    Please see the examples in [the above section](#tasks-and-examples).

2. The code would canonicalize SMILES string automatically, as long as it is wrapped in `<SMILES> ... </SMILES>`.

### Evaluation on SMolInstruct

#### Step 1. Generate responses for samples

Use the following command to apply LlaSMol models to generate responses for samples in SmolInstruct.

```bash
python generate_on_dataset.py --model_name osunlp/LlaSMol-Mistral-7B --output_dir eval/LlaSMol-Mistral-7B/output 
```

By default, it generates for all the tasks. You could also specify tasks by adding argument like `--tasks "['forward_synthesis','retrosynthesis']"`.
If not setting `tasks`, the script will generate for all the tasks in SMolInstruct.

#### Step 2. Extract predicted answer from model outputs

Use the command to extract predicted answers from model's output, and store them in the `pred` domains. By default, it extract the part between the corresponding tags (e.g., `<SMILES> ... </SMILES>`). If the tags are missing or incomplete, the extracted answer will be empty and regarded as "no answer" in metric calculation.

```bash
python extract_prediction.py --output_dir eval/LlaSMol-Mistral-7B/output --prediction_dir eval/LlaSMol-Mistral-7B/prediction
```

By default, it extracts predicted answers for all the tasks. It skips task if its output file is not found. You could also specify tasks like  `--tasks "['forward_synthesis','retrosynthesis']"`.

#### Step 3. Calculate metrics

Use the following command to compute metrics for all the tasks.

```bash
python compute_metrics.py --prediction_dir eval/LlaSMol-Mistral-7B/prediction
```

By default, it extracts predicted answers for all the tasks. It skips task if its output file is not found. You could also specify tasks like  `--tasks "['forward_synthesis','retrosynthesis']"`.
